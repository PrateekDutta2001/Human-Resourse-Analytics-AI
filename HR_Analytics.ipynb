        "### What is Employee Attrition\n",
        "\n",
        "Employee attrition, especially those of key and star employees is a major concern for an HR organization. When employees leave, it has many side effects. There is loss of organizational and product-specific expertise, loss of productivity due to new hires taking time to onboard. Sometimes employees have great relationships with customers, and that is hard to rebuild. There are also hiring costs and training costs associated. Employees leave due to various reasons. \n",
        "\n",
        "They include compensation, work satisfaction, performance, and issues with their supervisors. The online world had made it easy for outside recruiters to approach employees with better job offers, which can make a content employee leave. \n",
        "\n",
        "### How can AI help in this employee attrition? \n",
        "\n",
        "First, we need to collect 360-degree data about the employee's past and present. This include, but not limited to the tenure in the company, performance ratings, compensation and promotions. Relationships the employee has with their supervisor and peers also play a key part. 360 reviews will help understand this. Once the data is collected and associated with both past and present employees, it provides input to build an ML model to predict attrition. Then, HR can take preventive action that is needed."

        "# Classification Using Deep Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's quickly review the concept of classification in machine learning and its implementation in deep learning. Classification is a machine learning problem of identifying a set of categories to which a new observation belongs based on a training dataset that contains observations for which the category is already known. Classification is the most common type of machine learning problem. \n",
        "\n",
        "Examples include binary classification, like if a customer would buy a product or not, or multiclass classification, like determining the type of customer based on customer demographics. There are also a number of libraries that provide implementation of these algorithms. In Python, the most popular one is scikit-learn. \n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized classification with its ability to handle complex relationships and generate highly accurate models. If you're not familiar with deep learning, I recommend watching other courses on this website that explains the basics of deep learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use Keras library with TensorFlow backend for building the classification model."

        "The first column is employee ID. \n",

In classification, it's always a good idea to understand the relationship between the feature and the target variables, especially which feature variables have the most impact on the target variable. We do so using correlation analysis. Here, we do a correlation analysis on the target variable, attrition.\n",

The number of unique output classes is two. We will create hidden layers for 128 units. We will also do a validation split of 0.2. This means 20% of the data will be used for validation while building the model. I highly recommend experimenting with the hyper parameters to understand how they impact model accuracy. \n",

        "Now, we can create a Keras model. Then we add a dense, hidden layer with ReLU as activation. We then add a second hidden layer. Finally, we add an output dense layer with softmax activation. We compiled the model with Adam optimizer and use categorical crossentropy as the last function. We also measure the accuracy of the model. Then we fit the model for this input data. This set of steps is a standard template for building basic deep learning models.We can see that the model ended up with an accuracy of 99%. "

Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing.
