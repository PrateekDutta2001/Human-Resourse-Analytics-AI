# Human-Resourse-Analytics-AI

A global economy and remote workforce have made it difficult for HR departments to track employee satisfaction and motivation. However, using artificial intelligence, data scientists and engineers can now generate powerful insights to improve hiring, training, retention, and more. We will explore the ways AI and big data can help HR.

We will Examine three key use cases in the human resources world:

predicting employee attrition

mapping collaboration

creating training recommendations.

For each of these use cases, we processe data, builds machine learning models, and predicts key outcomes using tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
